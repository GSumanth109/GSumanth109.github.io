## Professional Bio

<div>
I am a Computer Vision Researcher and undergraduate Engineering student at SRMIST, currently pursuing my exchange at Waseda University, Tokyo. I am also working as an undergraduate researcher at the Sawada Lab in Waseda University. My core technical focus is the development of real-time processing systems and full-stack SLAM architectures that bridge complex deep learning models with robust system integration. I specialize in optimizing solutions using PyTorch, C++, ROS2, and Linux/Docker for deployment in low-latency and embedded environments.<br><br>

I am strongly motivated to apply my expertise to leading-edge Computer Vision and Spatial Computing applications where ultra-low-latency 3D perception is a core requirement. My project, the DLC-Live-PyTorch optimization pipeline, is a direct demonstration of this capability, having achieved 60 FPS @ 16ms latency through full-stack optimization and a custom Hotswap Memory Manager. This experience in pushing deep learning inference to the limits of real-time performance is essential for delivering the instantaneous pose prediction and 3D rendering systems required for applications in telepresence, real-time environment rendering, and advanced robotics. I am eager to apply my skills in high-throughput, deployable AI to accelerate the realization of next-generation Computer Vision solutions across the industry.
