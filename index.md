## Professional Bio

<div>
I am a Computer Vision Researcher and undergraduate Engineering student at SRMIST, currently pursuing my exchange at Waseda University, Tokyo. I am also working as an undergraduate researcher at the Sawada Lab in Waseda University. My core technical focus is the development of real-time processing systems and full-stack SLAM architectures that bridge complex deep learning models with robust system integration. I specialize in optimizing solutions using PyTorch, C++, ROS2, and Linux/Docker for deployment in low-latency and embedded environments.<br><br>

I am strongly motivated to contribute to **Sony's computer vision and spatial computing initiatives**, as my expertise directly tackles the challenge of **ultra-low-latency 3D perception**—a requirement for projects like Sony CSL's **JackIn Space**. My project, the **DLC-Live-PyTorch** pipeline, achieved **60 FPS @ 16ms latency** through full-stack optimization features and a custom Hotswap Memory Manager. This experience in pushing deep learning inference to the limits of real-time performance by addressing bottlenecks is essential for delivering the **instantaneous pose prediction and 3D rendering** systems required for low-latency applications like telepresence and real-time environment rendering. I am eager to apply my skills in high-throughput, deployable AI to accelerate the realization of next-generation Computer Vision solutions across the Sony Group.
