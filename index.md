## Professional Bio

I am a **Computer Vision Researcher** and undergraduate Engineering student at SRMIST, currently pursuing my exchange at **Waseda University, Tokyo**. I am also working as an undergraduate researcher at the Sawada Lab in Waseda University. My core technical focus is the development of **real-time processing systems** and **full-stack SLAM architectures** that bridge complex deep learning models with robust system integration. I specialize in optimizing solutions using **PyTorch, C++, ROS2, and Linux/Docker** for deployment in low-latency and embedded environments.

I am particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity at Sony because my research in **high-throughput perception** directly addresses your work on **3D/4D Generation and Perception** and **Human Augmentation** (e.g., Telepresence projects). My projects, from building a **60 FPS PyTorch pose estimation pipeline (DLC-Live)** to my current research on integrating **Semantic Segmentation into Gaussian Splatting** parameters, reflect a commitment to creating efficient, semantically rich 3D digital environments—a foundational technology for the next generation of Sony's **AR/VR, Virtual Production, and Spatial Computing** solutions.
